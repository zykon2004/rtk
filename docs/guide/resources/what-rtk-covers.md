# What RTK Optimizes

Once RTK is installed with a hook, these commands are automatically intercepted and filtered. You run them normally — the hook rewrites them transparently before execution.

Typical savings: 60-99%.

## Git

| Command | Savings | What changes |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `git status` | 75-93% | Compact stat format, grouped by state |
| `git log` | 80-92% | Hash + author + subject only |
| `git diff` | 70% | Context reduced, headers stripped |
| `git show` | 70% | Same as diff |
| `git stash list` | 75% | Compact one-line per entry |

## GitHub CLI

| Command | Savings | What changes |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `gh pr view` | 87% | Removes ASCII art and verbose metadata |
| `gh pr checks` | 79% | Status + name only, failures highlighted |
| `gh run list` | 82% | Compact workflow run summary |
| `gh issue view` | 80% | Body only, no decoration |

| `psql` | 65% | Query results without decoration |
| `curl` | 60% | Response body only, headers stripped |

## Global flags

These flags apply to all RTK commands and can push savings even higher:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--ultra-compact` | ASCII icons, inline format — extra token reduction on top of normal filtering |
| `-v` / `--verbose` | Show filtering details on stderr (`-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv` for increasing detail) |

```bash
# Ultra-compact: even smaller output
rtk git log --ultra-compact

# Debug: see what RTK is doing
rtk git status -vvv
```

:::note
Use `--ultra-compact` (long form) rather than `-u` when working with Git commands. Git's own `-u` flag means `--set-upstream` and the short form can cause confusion.
:::

## Commands that are not rewritten

If a command isn't in the list above, RTK runs it through passthrough — the output reaches the LLM unchanged. You can explicitly track unsupported commands:

```bash
rtk proxy make install    # runs make install, tracks usage, no filtering
```

To check which commands were missed opportunities: `rtk discover`.
